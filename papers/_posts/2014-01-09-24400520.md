# Abstract

Hidden semi-Markov models are effective at modelling sequences with succession of homogenous zones by choosing appropriate state duration distributions. To compensate for model mis-specification and provide protection against outliers, we design a robust hidden semi-Markov model with Student's t mixture models as the emission distributions. The proposed approach is used to model array based comparative genomic hybridization data. Experiments conducted on the benchmark data from the Coriell cell lines, and glioblastoma multiforme data illustrate the reliability of the technique.
